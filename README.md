## FAQ
- Can I use PlantUML-styler to style UML diagrams of types other than Sequence-diagram? like for example Usecase-diagram?
  - You can certainly try. As per the 6th of Januari 2020 this isn't really supported. Although some diagrams may work, we can't say for   certain it works well. If there is functionality for different UML types that you really want to use, Add it yourself! every bit of     help is highly appreciated.

- Is there an easy way to share these diagrams?
  - There is! Just press the download button 
  
    ![download](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/plantuml-styler/blob/master/Readme_Assets/download.png)
    
    This will give you a ".zip" file, this file contains png's and every bit of information needed to import it into PlantUML-styler.
    
    Either press the 
    
    ![plus](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/plantuml-styler/blob/master/Readme_Assets/Plus.png)
    
    or the 
    
    ![import json](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/plantuml-styler/blob/master/Readme_Assets/ImportJSON.png)
    
    button and select the downloaded ".zip" file.
    This will open the exact diagram you downloaded and you can change anything you want!
- How do I change the environment variables like the default server?
  - there is a file called [environment.prod.ts](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/plantuml-styler/blob/master/src/environments/environment.prod.ts) change the base to whatever server you want, this will set it as default
